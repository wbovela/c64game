# c64game
c64 game code in assembly for kick assembler

When I was little I had a C64 and tought myself the basics of assembly language. I never really understood how 
the more advanced techniques worked. With the Internet as a resource it's much easier to figure out what I 
didn't understand back then. This project is intended to explore techniques like 

- stabilised raster interrupts (using timers, double interrupts or sprites)
- character sets
- tile based game maps and boards
- physics in games
- soft scrolling
- several graphical tricks like hyperscreen and Flexible Line Interpretation (FLI) mode

Eventually this code may be included in a demo or a simple game.
